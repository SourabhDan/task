Data Science Challenge
One of the objectives of BI team at  Instamotion is to help understand vehicle information.

The dataset can be found in the repo under test.json:


The Challenge
The challenge has two parts:
1. Extract data from json file into a readable dataframe format.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (be open minded and feel free to choose interesting columns which can describe a vehicle uniquely)
  Perform exploratory data analysis to better understand the data and summarise your findings. 
  Please use well-labeled charts and tables during the analysis. To get you started, these are some questions that could be interesting:

  What is the overall vehilce ratio by make/model combination ?
  How does overall vehicle history affect the financing options?


Please complete the tasks using Python or R and you are free to use any and all third party libraries to help you.
Take note that this is supposed to be a simple task to assess your analytical skills. 
Please don't feel like you have to invest multiple hours to complete it, maximum 2 hours.
